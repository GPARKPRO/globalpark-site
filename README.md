# 🌐 Global Park — Web3 Frontend for the Community

Welcome to the public repository of **Global Park DAO** — a decentralized initiative at the intersection of art, technology, and collective memory.

This repository contains the open-source frontend code powering [https://globalpark.io](https://globalpark.io), the main gateway to the Global Park ecosystem.

## 🚀 Vision

Global Park is more than just a website — it’s a living interface to a decentralized cultural project where every contributor can:

- Connect their wallet and interact with DAO mechanisms
- Explore on-chain governance and proposals
- Participate in staking, drops, and presence-based rewards
- Discover and claim phygital NFT objects linked to real-world installations

Everything you see here is fully transparent and open to the community.
