# âˆ½ðŸ’ª Architecture

Global Park integrates both physical and digital infrastructure to support decentralized governance and cultural preservation.

## Digital Layer

- NFT-based identity and reputation
- Smart contracts for access and incentives
- On-chain registries and content verification
- DAO dashboard for governance operations

## Physical Layer

- Interactive exhibition pavilions
- Token-gated spaces and events
- Sensors and IoT integration for data capture
- Cultural spaces as real-world nodes

The synergy between these layers allows Global Park to exist as persistent cultural system â€“ both online and in real space.
