# ⌐😌 Tokenomics

The 'GPARK' token is the economic engine of the Global Park DAO, designed to enable transfers of cultural value and memory.

## Key themes

- Token distribution among stakeholders, community, and legacy
- Supply limited and transparent
- Non-speculative in nature; value created by use, not market frenzies
- Long-term sustainability via slow-release

- Redistribution via eth-weighted voting, staking, community rewards, team consensus

## Primary uses

- Mission-supporters
- Founding members + delegates
- Single-signature voters (via Snapshot)
- Non-financialized community engagement
