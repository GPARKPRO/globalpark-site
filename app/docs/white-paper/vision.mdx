# Vision & Philosophy

Global Park DAO is a next-generation cultural system in which digital artifacts (NFTs) become the foundation for creating physical installations, public spaces, and architectural expressions of memory.

We are building more than just a token ecosystem — we’re designing a living cultural landscape, where each unit of digital heritage is anchored in space, tied to coordinates, and brought to life.

## Three Core Pillars

### 🌐 Art as Infrastructure

**Not decoration, but the backbone of public architecture.**  
Every block is a message — and every message, a building element.

---

### 🔍 Technology as Transparency

**Every proposal, transaction, and object is visible on-chain.**  
Governance is open. Control is distributed.

---

### 🧠 Memory as Coordination

**Physical and digital memory objects work as infrastructure:**  
not only static records, but dynamic anchors of interaction.
