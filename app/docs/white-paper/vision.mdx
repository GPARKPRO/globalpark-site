# Vision & Philosophy

Global Park DAO is a next-generation cultural system in which digital artifacts (NFTs) become the foundation for creating physical installations, public spaces, and architectural expressions of memory.

We are building more than just a token ecosystem — we’re designing a living cultural landscape, where each unit of digital heritage is anchored in space, tied to coordinates, and brought to life.

## Three Core Pillars

<div className="space-y-6">

  <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
    <img src="public/icons/Scheme-1.svg" alt="Art as Infrastructure" className="w-10 h-10 mt-1" />
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Art as Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>Not decoration, but the backbone of public architecture. Every block is a message — and every message, a building element.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
    <img src="public/icons/Scheme-4.svg" alt="Technology as Transparency" className="w-10 h-10 mt-1" />
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Technology as Transparency</h3>
      <p>Every proposal, transaction, and object is visible on-chain. Governance is open. Control is distributed.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
    <img src="public/icons/Scheme-6.svg" alt="Memory as Coordination" className="w-10 h-10 mt-1" />
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Memory as Coordination</h3>
      <p>Physical and digital memory objects work as infrastructure: not only static records, but dynamic anchors of interaction.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
