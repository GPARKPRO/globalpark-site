# Governance Structure

The governance of Global Park DAO is founded on transparency, participation, and memory-layered structure.

At its core, the system uses a three-tiered governance model:

- **Strategic Consultative Board**
- **Elected Representatives (bow agents)**
- **Communities with voting rights**

---

## 🧭 How it Works

1. **Proposals** can be submitted on-chain to be voted on by holders.

2. **Results** are recorded immutably, and the source code is transparent.

3. **Elected representatives** take proposals back and submit them to the Board.

This enables a responsible, schematic and culture-aligned framework for decision-making.
