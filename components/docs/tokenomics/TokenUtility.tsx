        2. Purpose and Nature of the GPARK Token
      </h2>

      <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-4">
        The GPARK token was created as a key to accessing the architecture of the Global
        Park project. It is not a security, an investment instrument, or a passive income
        vehicle. Its role is to enable participation, activate features, and support the DAO
        economy through direct interaction with the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">Core Functions of the Token</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-neutral-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Access to cultural and spatial infrastructure:</strong> GPARK is used to activate NFT coordinates,
          access gated zones, rent IRL objects, and participate in the programmable park.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Participation in DAO Governance:</strong> Token holders may initiate and vote on proposals via Snapshot,
          influence the DAO budget, and shape the ecosystem’s evolution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Staking and Proof-of-Presence mechanics:</strong> The token is staked to gain access to voting, events,
          NFT drops, and future upgrades.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Involvement and contribution:</strong> GPARK serves as a means to record participation in cultural initiatives,
          events, collaborations, and the park’s digital memory.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">Token Properties</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-neutral-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Immutable:</strong> The token contract does not allow for additional minting, owner
          changes, or admin access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">DAO-managed:</strong> All significant actions involving the token (distribution, vesting,
          partner allocations) are carried out through DAO decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Non-financial:</strong> The token does not imply profit or yield, nor does it grant any
          ownership rights or dividends.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-neutral-300">
        GPARK is not designed for speculative trading. Its value is derived from active
        participation, cultural significance, and the limited access to space it enables.
