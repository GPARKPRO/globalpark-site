        The distribution of GPARK tokens is designed to support sustainability, transparency,
        and long-term coordination through the DAO. All actions related to token usage are
        regulated by smart contracts, governed by DAO votes, and verifiably recorded on-chain.
        The total token supply is fixed at 21,000,000 GPARK, with no possibility of modification.
