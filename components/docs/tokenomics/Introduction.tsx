      <h1>GPARK Tokenomics</h1>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        GPARK is not an investment token, but a utility asset at the core of the architectural
        design of a decentralized cultural space. It is intended for activation, participation,
        governance, and coordination within the Global Park DAO ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document outlines the economic model of the GPARK token, its distribution,
        usage principles, and sustainable growth mechanisms aligned with DAO operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of decentralized governance and the absence of centralized issuance,
        GPARK tokenomics is built on the following principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scarcity:</strong> The total token supply is permanently capped at 21 million GPARK.
          No additional issuance is possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency:</strong> Token distribution, vesting schedules, and treasury actions are
          fully verifiable on-chain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Participation over profit:</strong> The token does not offer financial guarantees and
          serves instead as a tool for cultural activation and network coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DAO as the center of trust:</strong> Token and treasury management are executed
          via smart contracts, Snapshot voting, and public DAO infrastructure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document is intended for partners, exchanges, grant organizations, institutional
        stakeholders, and anyone interacting with GPARK as a Web3 coordination tool â€” not
        as a speculative asset.
