        GPARK is not an investment token, but a utility asset at the core of the architectural
        design of a decentralized cultural space. It is intended for activation, participation,
        governance, and coordination within the Global Park DAO ecosystem.

      <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-4">
        This document outlines the economic model of the GPARK token, its distribution,
        usage principles, and sustainable growth mechanisms aligned with DAO operations.

        In the context of decentralized governance and the absence of centralized issuance,
        GPARK tokenomics is built on the following principles:

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-neutral-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Scarcity:</strong> The total token supply is permanently capped at 21 million GPARK.
          No additional issuance is possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Transparency:</strong> Token distribution, vesting schedules, and treasury actions are
          fully verifiable on-chain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">Participation over profit:</strong> The token does not offer financial guarantees and
          serves instead as a tool for cultural activation and network coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white">DAO as the center of trust:</strong> Token and treasury management are executed
          via smart contracts, Snapshot voting, and public DAO infrastructure.
        </li>
      </ul>

        This document is intended for partners, exchanges, grant organizations, institutional
        stakeholders, and anyone interacting with GPARK as a Web3 coordination tool â€” not
        as a speculative asset.
